# p2pp - **Palette2 Post Processing tool for PrusaSlicer/Slic3r PE**

## IMPORTANT
This is a backup of Tom Vandeneed's repository, as they decided p2pp was no longer working with newer slicers. 
I have put up this repository with the last version of Tom's code. 
I will be fixing stuff I personally have problems with if i am able.
I will take this down if Tom wants me to.

## Getting strarted

Have a look at the [P2PP Wiki pages](https://github.com/ThomasNyk/p2ppUnofficial) to get youstarted.
